# crystal-game

This is a simple game that I made demonstrating javascript and JQuery. I like to look back on this project to see where I began.

## Getting Started

You may run locally otherwise below is a link to the deployed project. 

## Prerequisites/Technologies Used

* Javascript
* JQuery
* GitHub Pages

### Installing

You may clone the repository into a new directory of your choice and preview in the browser.

### Future development

I would experiment with mobile reactiveness. I would also like to recreate this game using React.

## Deployment

This has been deployed via [GitHub Pages] (https://zoosissoos.github.io/crystal-game/)
